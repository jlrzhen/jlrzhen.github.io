 # Jeffrey's Personal Website

[View Page](https://jlrzhen.github.io)

The purpose of this site is to show a 
collection of my personal projects, while 
allowing me to demonstrate concepts I've learned 
from front-end web development using React. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
