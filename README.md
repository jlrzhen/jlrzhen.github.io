 # Jeffrey's Personal Website

[View Page](https://jlrzhen.github.io)

The purpose of this site is to show a 
collection of my personal projects, while 
allowing me to demonstrate concepts I've learned 
from front-end web development using React. 

This project was bootstrapped with [create-vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).
